# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Usage
Before building, make sure you create a `.env` file in the root. To the root, add your firebase API key as follows:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
```

To build the project, run:
```bash
vite build
```

or

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the development server, run:
```bash
vite preview
```

or 

```bash
npm run dev
```
